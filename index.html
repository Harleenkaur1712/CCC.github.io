                           <br> Let your child express their feelings. It is important to allow your child to feel whatever they are feeling, whether it is sadness, anger, fear, or confusion. Let them know that their feelings are valid and that you are there for them.
                           <br> Stay positive. It is important to stay positive and hopeful, even though cancer is a serious illness. Your child will look to you for strength and support, so it is important to project an optimistic attitude.
                           <br> Help your child maintain a normal routine as much as possible. This may include going to school, participating in extracurricular activities, and spending time with friends and family. Maintaining a normal routine can help your child feel a sense of normalcy and control during a time of uncertainty.
                           <br> Seek professional help if needed. There are many resources available to help children with cancer and their families. If you are struggling to cope, do not hesitate to reach out for help.</p>
